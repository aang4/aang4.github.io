        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p> Amanda Ang is a third year PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Southern California. Her main research interests are in environmental and urban economics, including but not limited to, housing, transportation and the impact of natural disasters. She is especially interested in how the spatial configuration of resources and shocks can affect their outcomes and proposed policy solutions. For example, in a working paper with Antonio Bento (USC Price School of Policy) and Peter Christensen (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), they find that the social costs (increased travel time due to delays) of flooding are concentrated in certain locations in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and estimate the benefits of conducting infrastructure upgrading in those locations. Amanda is passionate about creating beautiful data visualizations and learning how to be a more efficient coder for research. In her spare time, she enjoys poetry, literature, learning other languages, boxing and she holds leadership positions in a few non-profits which are aimed at providing opportunities for personal and professional development for women in high school, college and at the graduate level. </p>
